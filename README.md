- **Data cleaning documentation:** `reports/cleaning_billionaires.html` 
- **Reproducible code:** `src/`

## Methods
- Binned countries by the global median gross primary enrollment rate (High vs Low)
- Compared industry counts and median net worth by industry and enrollment group
- Visualized results with ggplot2
