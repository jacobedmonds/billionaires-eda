# Billionaires EDA: Education & Industry

## Summary
Exploratory data analysis examining how billionaire industry concentration and median net worth differ between countries with high vs low gross primary enrollment rates.

## Deliverables
- **Main report:** `reports/billionaires_project.pdf`
- **Data cleaning documentation:** `reports/cleaning_billionaires.html` 
- **Reproducible code:** `src/`

## Methods
- Binned countries by the global median gross primary enrollment rate (High vs Low)
- Compared industry counts and median net worth by industry and enrollment group
- Visualized results with ggplot2

## Tools
R, dplyr, ggplot2, RMarkdown

## Notes / Limitations
Country-level enrollment may not reflect individual billionaire educational attainment; net worth is a snapshot and can fluctuate.
